# Traits 

TraitForge's goal is to bring real value to the NFT marketplace by providing players with incentives to play and interact. This is achieved through a competition, as players compete for a percentage claim to a "Nuke Fund" (ETH pool). Each TraitForge entity is provided with a set of parameters that represent the entity's functional value through its access to the "Nuke Fund".

###  These Traits are: 

- Nuke Factor 
- Forge Potential 
- Performance Factor
- Role 

Each of these traits provides unique gameplay factors that players will utilize to compete for the "Nuke Fund".
