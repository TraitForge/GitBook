# TRAIT Token Airdrop

TraitForge will receive an airdrop of $TRAIT tokens, which can be initiated at any time. Each instance of direct minting or forging to mint is recorded in the Airdrop Contract, along with the entropy of the minted entity. This process establishes a comprehensive tracking system for the total number of entities minted by each player and their corresponding entropy. In the event that a player 'nukes' an entity, the entropy allocated by that entity is removed. The cumulative entropy accrued by a player determines their final share of the airdrop. It is anticipated that the airdrop will be initiated within the first year of gameplay to facilitate a broader distribution of $TRAIT tokens.
