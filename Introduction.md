# Introduction

Traitforge is a revolutionary NFT honeypot game designed to bring value back to the NFT ecosystem by creating a competitive PVP community within the the game. Traitforge introduces "Entities", NFTs with programmatically generated art evolving through ten unique generations. Each generation features distinct physical traits and colors, coupled with randomly assigned parameters that allow claims to the nuke fund, forging, marketplace sales and gameplay enhancing features. 

Each generation holds 10,000 entities which are available for minting, starting at 0.005 ETH and increasing linearly to 50 ETH per generation. The Nuke Fund accumulates ETH from minting and economic activities, offering a unique mechanism where entities can be "nuked" to claim a share of the fund. Unique parameters called "traits" will dictate the value of an entities claim to the nuke fund along with other core gameplay features.

TraitForge is exclusive in its gameplay methods, giving players the ability to choose their preferred playstyle. Playstyles vary from fast paced minting to nuke, selling entities on the marketplace and forging to create new more powerful entities.
Traitforge isn't just an NFT project; it's a pioneering venture that combines innovative gameplay mechanics with the potential for significant returns, setting a new standard in the NFT landscape.
