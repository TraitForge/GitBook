# The Long Game Aging and Maximizing Nuke Value

### The Long Game Aging and Maximizing Nuke Value:

Players who are in it for the long haul might adopt a strategy focused on aging their entities to maximize their nuke value. By waiting until an entity reaches full maturity, they can nuke it for a substantial portion of the Nuke Fund. This strategy requires patience and a calculated risk assessment, as holding onto an entity for too long could mean missing out on optimal nuke opportunities. It suits players who are less interested in the breeding aspects and more in maximizing returns from the nuke mechanism.
