# Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
    <summary>Question: Wen launch?</summary>
    Answer: 8th of October for the whitelist participants, 24 hours later - public launch. **UTC (Coordinated Universal Time): 12:30 PM** the minting will be enabled.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: How to mint?</summary>
    Answer: Go to https://traitforge.game website, connect your wallet and start minting either with a single mint (one transaction mints one NFT) or a batch mint (one transaction with a set amount of ETH mints multiple NFTs). For testnet, having some Ethereum Sepolia on the Base blockchain is needed. For the mainnet launch, you will be able to mint with Ethereum on Base (if you don't have ETH on Base chain (L1 ETH is not supported!), bridging will be necessary).
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: How much time do whitelist participants have to mint their NFTs?</summary>
    Answer: 24 hours when minting is enabled. After that time everybody will be able to mint.

## Gameplay/Strategy/Tokenomics

<details>
    <summary>Question: What is TraitForge?</summary>
    Answer: TraitForge is an NFT breeding and nuking game that combines strategy with value-accrual. Players can mint, forge, sell, or nuke NFT entities to gain rewards from the Nuke Fund, a central pool of ETH on the Base chain.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: How does breeding work in TraitForge?</summary>
    Answer: Breeding (or forging) is performed by combining two NFT entities (a "Merger" and a "Forger"). This produces a new generation entity that inherits traits from both parents.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: What is the Nuke Fund?</summary>
    Answer: The Nuke Fund is a pool of ETH collected from mint fees and in-game activities primarily through minting which transfers 85% of each mint to the Nuke Fund. Players can nuke (burn) their NFT to claim a share of the fund. The percentage of the fund claimable depends on the NFT's Nuke Factor, which increases as it ages.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: What are "Forger" and "Merger" roles?</summary>
    Answer: Entities are either "Forgers" or "Mergers." Forgers are required to breed new entities, and Mergers pay fees to forge with them. The roles are assigned during the initial mint, with a 2:1 bias towards Mergers.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: How does the ageing process work?</summary>
    Answer: NFT entities age over time, determined by their Performance Factor. Faster-ageing entities reach maturity in about 30 days, while slower ones can take up to 600 days. Full maturity means a maximum Nuke Factor of 50%, making them highly valuable for nuking or forging.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: What is the "Golden God"?</summary>
    Answer: The Golden God is a special NFT entity with perfect parameters, giving it a significant edge over other entities if played correctly. It’s a unique entity designed to be highly sought-after.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: What is the economic model of TraitForge?</summary>
    Answer: The game involves minting, forging, and nuking to generate ETH for the Nuke Fund. Mint fees, forge fees, and sales fees feed into this fund. Players earn from forging new entities or claiming rewards from the Nuke Fund.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: What happens if I "nuke" my NFT entity?</summary>
    Answer: Nuking means permanently burning your NFT to claim a share of the ETH from the Nuke Fund. The amount you can claim depends on the entity's Nuke Factor, which can reach a maximum of 50%.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: What happens to the game if the Nuke Fund runs out?</summary>
    Answer: The Nuke Fund is designed to be sustainable by limiting any single entity's claim to a maximum of 50%. If activities like minting, forging, or sales decline, the DAO participants can adjust game parameters to keep the fund active and maintain player engagement.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: What platforms will TraitForge launch on?</summary>
    Answer: TraitForge will first launch on the Base L2 chain and then be ported to Solana later.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: What are the main strategies in TraitForge?</summary>
    Answer: Players can adopt different strategies like holding entities to age them, forging until infertility, selling from mint, or nuking to win. Each strategy has different risks and rewards based on game progression and Nuke Fund growth.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: What is the minting structure for TraitForge?</summary>
    Answer: TraitForge has 10 generations of entities, each containing 10,000 NFTs. The minting starts at 0.005 ETH, with prices increasing linearly by 0.0000245 ETH. For example, Gen 1 reaches a final mint price of 0.25 ETH, while Gen 2 ends at 0.30 ETH. Mint revenue is distributed 90% to the Nuke Fund and 10% to the Dev Fund.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: How does the ageing mechanism affect entities in TraitForge?</summary>
    Answer: Entities age based on their Performance Factor, which ranges from 1 to 9. Entities with a higher Performance Factor mature faster, with the maximum Performance Factor resulting in full maturity in about 30 days. Entities with the lowest Performance Factor take up to 730 days to reach full maturity.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: How does the Forge Potential of an entity work?</summary>
    Answer: Forge Potential determines the number of times an entity can forge before becoming infertile. Every time an entity forges, a point is deducted from its Forge Potential. After a year, the Forge Potential resets to its original value.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: What visual progression do TraitForge entities go through?</summary>
    Answer: TraitForge features a generational visual evolution where entities progress from human-like to cyborgs, and eventually into full machines. This adds a compelling visual narrative that distinguishes each generation from the previous one.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: What determines an entity’s share of the Nuke Fund?</summary>
    Answer: The Nuke Factor represents an entity’s claim to the Nuke Fund. Upon minting, entities receive a Nuke Factor between 1% and 10%, which can increase to a maximum of 50% through gameplay and ageing.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: What are the roles of "Forger" and "Merger" in TraitForge?</summary>
    Answer: Entities are either "Forgers" or "Mergers." Forgers can list themselves for a fee to forge with a Merger. Mergers pay the fee to create new entities. Roles are assigned during the initial mint, with a 1:2 ratio of Forgers to Mergers.
</details>

## $TRAIT Token Airdrop

<details>
    <summary>Question: How does the TRAIT airdrop work?</summary>
    Answer: The TRAIT token airdrop distributes 55% of the total 1 billion supply to players based on Player Total Entropy (PTE). This reflects player contributions and ownership. Other allocations include 15% for the Dev Fund, 5% for KOLs/Partners, 15% for referrals, and 10% for market liquidity.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: What are the conditions for the TRAIT airdrop?</summary>
    Answer: Before the airdrop, developers can withdraw from the Dev Fund to cover costs. After the airdrop is triggered, a 30-day period accumulates rewards, preventing developer withdrawals. Once ended, 10% of $TRAIT is added to Uniswap as liquidity, and LP tokens are locked for public trading.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: What is Player Total Entropy (PTE)?</summary>
    Answer: PTE is the accumulated entropy value of all NFTs owned by a player. It determines their share in the airdrop allocation, reflecting their engagement and contributions to the game.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Question: How are liquidity and token stability ensured after the airdrop?</summary>
    Answer: After the 30-day accumulation period, the game will add liquidity to Uniswap using the collected ETH and 10% of the $TRAIT supply, locking the liquidity provider (LP) tokens. This mechanism ensures market stability and allows $TRAIT to be publicly traded.
