# Generations

TraitForge has 10 generations, the inital mint upon game launch is gen1, this will increase as the game is played, to gens 2, 3 ect. Each generation holds a pre-determined array of 10,000 entities. The Mint fee for each generation is the same as Gen 1 (starting at 0.005 ETH, incrementing by 0.000245 ETH upto the 10,000th entity). 

Generation max mint price will increase as genreations progress, generations 1-4 are initaly set as seen below. Later generations are not currently set, as gens 1-4 will give feedback for game-play. 

```solidity
Final Entity Price 
â€¨Gen 1: 0.25 ETH
Gen 2: 0.30 ETH
Gen 3: 0.35 ETH
Gen 4: 0.4 ETH
``` 

Each generation has a new "TraitForger" character image. This allows players to easily identify entity generations while providing a diverse visual experience to the gameplay. Generation count is increased upon the minting of an entity or the creation of new entities through forging. 


## Code and Functions 

1. Generation Management Variables

These variables track the current generation number, the total circulation of tokens across all generations, and the count of tokens minted in each generation.

``` solidity
uint256 public currentGeneration = 1;
uint256 public totalGenerationCirculation = 0;
mapping(uint256 => uint256) public generationMintCounts;
```

2. Function _incrementGeneration()

This function increments the generation number and resets the mint count for the new generation, ensuring the token cap per generation is enforced.

```solidity
  function _incrementGeneration() private {
    require(
      generationMintCounts[currentGeneration] >= maxTokensPerGen,
      'Generation limit not yet reached'
    );
    currentGeneration++;
    generationMintCounts[currentGeneration] = 0;
    entropyGenerator.initializeAlphaIndices();
    emit GenerationIncremented(currentGeneration);
  }
``` 

Other relevant generation advancement code can be found in "forging" and the "_mintInternal" functions. In the  "forging" function when a new entity is forged and created it is added to the circulation of the next generation. 
Function "_mintInternal" has logic to increment the current generation upon a mint and track the entity count through generations.

```solidity
 // Update generation and circulation
    currentGeneration++;
    totalGenerationCirculation++;
``` 
```solidity
function _mintInternal(address to, uint256 mintPrice) internal {
    if (generationMintCounts[currentGeneration] >= MAX_TOKENS_PER_GEN) {
      _incrementGeneration();
    }
```
